## Tom Betts
I am a full stack developer excited to have found a vocation in software development. I'd love to contribute to a development team that cares about doing great work for every client where I can learn continuously and make a positive impact to both culture and code.

## Skills

#### Communcation

I have always considered communictaion to be one of my strengths. During my Politics and History degree I was often involved in group work and discussions in seminars. While at Makers Academy I found myself well suited to pair programming and was a good team player in group projects, with strong contributions at standups and retros.

#### Fast Learning

I pick things up quickly. Although new to coding I adapted well to the speed of the Makers course, and am quick to grasp new languages and technologies. For example, during my final project I became confident writing Python code within a few hours. I am extremely tenacious and will keep driving at any issue until it is resolved, but I am not afraid or embarrassed to ask questions and when I don't understand something.

#### Problem Solving

I love problem solving and logic games of all kinds, and this is what first drew me to coding. I enjoy breaking down problems and methodically working through them, and feel at home tackling errors and debugging code. I particularly enjoy sites like Codewars, where I try to do 4 or 5 katas a day in a variety of languages to help keep me sharp. Here is a link to [my Codewars account](https://www.codewars.com/users/T-Betts)

## Experience

I have no work experience. After graduating university I had no idea what I wanted to do and itâ€™s fair to say that the four years between university and Makers Academy have not been a roaring success. I did a little travelling and was tempted by the idea of journalism but nothing really grabbed me. However, that changed after a conversation with a software developer. He suggested that I give coding a try and I was instantly hooked. I knew that this was something that I wanted to do and the three months at Makers Academy have only reinforced this feeling. I am truly passionate about coding and pursuing a career as a full stack web developer.
